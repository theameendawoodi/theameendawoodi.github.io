  <h3>Research Goals</h3>

  <p>
    The digital sphere has become a central site for propaganda, surveillance, and political communication. My research engages with these processes through the combined lenses of machine learning, philosophy, and the social sciences, with a focus on the Indian context. Underlying this work is a commitment to integrating ethical reflection into the analysis of how digital systems shape public discourse.
  </p>

  <p>
    Digital texts and platforms are not just carriers of information — they are structures of power, emotion, and persuasion. My work seeks to develop ways of reading these systems critically, combining computational analysis with ethical and philosophical reflection. The broader aim is to sustain a research practice that remains attentive to the social and moral consequences of data-driven life.
