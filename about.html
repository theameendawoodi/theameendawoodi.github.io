  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>I am a student and aspiring academician working across the boundaries of machine learning, philosophy, and the social sciences. My interests lie in how digital infrastructures shape political communication and experience — especially within the Indian context.</p>

  <p>I approach research as a form of attentive inquiry. I care about careful evaluation, critical perspective, and methods that allow us to notice not just what data reveals, but also what it omits, distorts, or amplifies. My work often moves between computation and critique, combining technical methods with conceptual thinking.</p>

  <p>Currently, I am exploring how digital propaganda operates in right-wing networks in India. This involves working with data, but also learning to read systems as texts — patterned, coded, and ideological. I am also interested in the study of surveillance, and how contemporary propaganda strategies are entangled with practices of watching, categorizing, and control.</p>

  <p>Alongside my academic work, I remain a critical observer of how technology — in the name of ease or entertainment — can quietly erode human attention, autonomy, and collective life. I often idealize the early internet as a kind of garden: open, strange, and alive with possibility — a garden now on fire. That sense of loss continues to shape how I read and respond to today’s digital landscapes.</p>

  <p>I am still in the process of becoming — learning to work between disciplines, to think more precisely, and to ask better questions.</p>
