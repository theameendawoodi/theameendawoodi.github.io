  <h1>Research</h1>

  <p>
    My current work focuses on how right-wing digital propaganda circulates on platforms like Twitter (X) in the Indian context.
    I am interested in the structural and emotional patterns behind these campaigns — how they frame political reality,
    mobilize attention, and obscure accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project draws on both machine learning techniques and critical perspectives on media, ideology, and power.
    I approach digital systems not just as technical infrastructures, but as cultural and political environments that shape
    the way people see, speak, and act.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am also attentive to how mechanisms of classification, recommendation, and behavioral targeting operate within these platforms —
    often quietly reinforcing dominant narratives and forms of control. These dynamics blur the line between influence and observation,
    raising deeper questions about visibility, freedom, and consent in digital life.
  </p>

  <p>
    At a broader level, I seek to explore how technical systems encode political intent,
    and how we might develop better ways of reading — and resisting — them.
