  <section id="why-this">
    <h2>1. Why this section</h2>
    <p>First off, this section and the others are now written by AI, and personally written by me, completely unedited other than for correct grammar. And another thing, the reason for the existence of this part is to explain the reason I created this page. In simple terms, I like to write and share it, the existing social media (the only one that I use is LinkedIn, also rarely), although LinkedIn is "good", but I don't really like it much. I can't speak LinkedIn, I am not that corporate, I guess. Anyway, on this page, I will share my thoughts and views on anything that I am reading or that I want to share my views about, my published work, the story behind, motivation and some funny stories, if any. So, have fun, I guess. And a final thing, this section will have 4 parts, the first, then personal blogs/ rant/ voice, then come commentaries on other works(maybe a book, research paper or topic), and finally mt published articles and research papers.</p>
