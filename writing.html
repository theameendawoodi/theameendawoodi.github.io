    <h2>1. Why this section</h2>
    <p>First off, this section and the others are now written by AI, and personally written by me, completely unedited other than for correct grammar. And another thing, the reason for the existence of this part is to explain the reason I created this page. In simple terms, I like to write and share it, the existing social media (the only one that I use is LinkedIn, also rarely), although LinkedIn is "good", but I don't really like it much. I can't speak LinkedIn, I am not that corporate, I guess. Anyway, on this page, I will share my thoughts and views on anything that I am reading or that I want to share my views about, my published work, the story behind, motivation and some funny stories, if any. So, have fun, I guess. And a final thing, this section will have 4 parts, the first, then personal blogs/ rant/ voice, then come commentaries on other works(maybe a book, research paper or topic), and finally mt published articles and research papers.</p>

  <p>Surveillance is always conducted on the people who are excluded from the idea of the state.
    <br>
  Surveillance is done to control and "police" people into disciplining themselves.
  <br>
  although modern surveillance is also done through a kind of trade where you share your details and they(the ones on power) provide something in return.

  <h3 id="some thoughts on privacy">2.Some Thoughts on privacy</h3>
    In Michel Foucault's panopticon, regulating self in certain way could mean that the panopticon is successful in itself and being anonymous in this digital age is to hide our packets and requests in other internet traffic like with Tor and VPN now,
    the dilemma is that should we move to anonymous and privacy based services and make the existence of panopticon success full or reject the unethical surveillance onto us, 
    maybe the answer to this dilemma starts with some questions, does complete anonymity online and offline exist in this digitally heavy world. 
    I mean, it's kinda possible for us to achieve anonymity online with encrypted mail, 
    messages, VPNs, Tor network and hardened, sandboxed and virtual machine Linux like Qubes with Whonix or customised Arch Linux for privacy. 
    If you were thinking of going LFS, dude, just why?. And good for you, maybe I'll be you someday, I guess. 
    But going anonymous offline seems near impossible, Aadhaar itself is a big tool for the panopticon, and you miss out on many things without Aadhaar, 
    so the question remains, is going full anonymous like ed snowden worth it...? That's it for today, folks and may the force be with you.
